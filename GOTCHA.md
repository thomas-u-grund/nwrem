# Gotchas of nwrem

Known, already diagnosed pitfalls. Entries copied from the nwcommands notes at the time of the split; some mention the core package.

## Attaching a covariate to an `eventtime()`-declared network needs `_nwnode`, not a fresh merge

After `nwset sender receiver, eventtime(t) name(netname)` declares an event network (found while
building the `socialevolution` example dataset, 2026-09-12), the dataset left in memory is **not**
the original sender/receiver/t rows anymore — it's one row per actor who appears in at least one
event, with columns `_nwnode` (the actor's own label) and `_nwinclude`. A `merge 1:1 label using
covariates.dta` fails outright (`variable label not found`) because there is no `label` variable to
merge on at that point; the actor identifier is `_nwnode`.

The fix is a rename-merge-rename:

```
rename _nwnode label
merge 1:1 label using covariates.dta, keep(master match) nogen
rename label _nwnode
```

This is unrelated to how covariates work on an already-`nwsave()`d panel dataset (`glasgow`, `s50`,
etc.), where attributes like `smoke1`/`alcohol1` are baked into the saved network file itself and
just show up as ordinary variables on load — no merge needed there at all. The rename-merge-rename
dance is specific to attaching a covariate *after the fact* onto a freshly `nwset`-declared event
network built from a plain, not-pre-declared dataset.

## Mata functions and programs defined inside an .ado file are private to that file

`mata: nwergm_estat_bridge_from_netobj(...)` called from a *different* .ado file fails with "not found" (3499): functions
(and `program`s) defined in an .ado are namespaced `file.name` and only callable from programs of the same file. Anything two
helper files need (observed-network bridge, summary functions) belongs in `unw_ergm.do` (the Mata library), as
`ergm_bridge_obs()`. Likewise `estat gof` plots call `_nwergm_gofplot`, a file of its own.

## Stata `syntax` flag options that start with "no" lose the prefix

`syntax [, NOMPLECHECK]` creates the local `mplecheck`, not `nomplecheck`; testing `"`nomplecheck'" == ""` is then always true.
Use a string option (`mplecheck(on|off)`) or a name that does not start with "no".
